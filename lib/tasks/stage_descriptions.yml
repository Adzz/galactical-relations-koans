:alpha: In the first stage, let's declare the relationship between the Sun and Planets. Suns should have many planets. And planets should belong to a sun
:beta:  Next up, planets have many moons and moons belong to a planet.
:gamma: Let's implement a basic has-and-belongs-to-many connection between planets and asteroids. The most straightforward way of implementing this association is with a join table.
:delta: This stage introduces the idea of a many-to-many "through" relationship. This is very similar to what we implemented with stage gamma but, this time, we have a model, 'Crewing', that represents the relationship.
:epsilon: This stage introduces the ideas that connections between models can run through other models. A sun has many moons, but only via its planets. Likewise, a moon orbits a sun but does so via a planet. This stage shouldn't require you to make any changes to the database as the relationships you need already exist on the database level.
